# /intake — conceive a task (via the Brain Intake Agent)

Turn raw input — a text-vomit idea, a bug report, a loose `ideas.md` bullet —
into a **formal, grouped, headed PyAutoMind prompt**, via PyAutoBrain's **Intake
Agent** (the *Conception Agent*). You never name the Brain; this command is the
door.

Shared routing context: `PyAutoBrain/skills/COMMANDS.md`.

## Do

1. Run `bin/pyauto-brain intake "<the raw text>"` (or `intake classify --file
   <path>`, or `intake ideas` to sweep `ideas.md`). This is a **dry run** — it
   classifies work-type + target, sizes difficulty, and shows the header it would
   write. Nothing is created.
2. Review the `IntakeDecision` with the user — correct the work-type, target,
   difficulty, autonomy or priority in conversation (this is the back-and-forth
   where scope, and therefore difficulty, is decided).
3. When it looks right, re-run with **`--apply`** to write the prompt file into
   PyAutoMind under `<work-type>/<target>/<name>.md` (or `triage/` if the
   classification is genuinely unclear).

Intake **files a prompt; it does not start development.** It is the step *before*
`/start_dev`. Once the prompt is written, `/start_dev <path>` routes it into the
dev workflow (issue, branch, plan). Do not bypass the Brain.

## Backlog view (census / dashboard)

- `bin/pyauto-brain intake census` — read-only inventory of every filed prompt
  (counts by work-type/target/difficulty/priority + hygiene flags for headerless
  legacy prompts). `--json` for the full records.
- `bin/pyauto-brain intake dashboard` — renders the census as the Mind
  **backlog** page; dry-run prints it, `--apply` writes
  `PyAutoMind/dashboard.md` (commit via `prompt_sync_push`). Backlog only —
  organism *health* is `/health`, not this page.
- `bin/pyauto-brain intake formalise [prefix]` — retroactively headers the
  prompts census flags (word-vomit is intent, not defect): derives the missing
  fields, inserts them in place with all prose verbatim, reports re-home
  suggestions instead of ever moving files. Dry-run proposes; `--apply` writes
  (then regenerate the dashboard).
- `bin/pyauto-brain intake reconcile [prefix]` — ranks backlog (`draft/`)
  prompts that look already-shipped (cross-referenced against the `complete/`
  archive — or the legacy `complete.md` until retired — and `active/`; a stale
  hand-set `Status:` is a signal, never proof). Always read-only: verify each
  suspect against the target repo's git log / merged PRs, then retire it to the
  `complete/` archive by hand (it is already done).

## Boundary

- **`/route`** infers a work-type and *dispatches* (starts dev now); **`/intake`**
  infers a work-type and *files a prompt* (defers).
- Low-confidence classification lands in `triage/` — the existing unclassified
  bucket, reused.
- Writes happen **only** under `--apply`; the default is a read-only dry run.
- **Machine sources** (scholar research runs, Heart findings, profiling
  results) stage as provenance-tagged `ideas.md` bullets — `- [from: <source>]
  <idea>` — and ride the same ideas sweep; intake learns no per-source formats
  (the conductor's "Machine sources" section is authoritative).
